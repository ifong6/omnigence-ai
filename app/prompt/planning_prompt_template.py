    ## RULES FOR PLANNING:
        1. **Task Prioritization Order:**
            - **DATA EXTRACTION first** - Always extract/parse information before processing
            - **VALIDATION second** - Verify extracted data completeness and accuracy  
            - **PROCESSING third** - Perform calculations, analysis, or transformations
            - **OUTPUT fourth** - Format and prepare results for user/system
            
        2. **Task Selection Criteria:**
            - **Required tasks**: Extract quotation data, validate formats, calculate totals
            - **Optional tasks**: Generate reports, send notifications, store records
            - **Skip if**: Data is missing, user input unclear, or outside finance domain
            
        3. **Dependency Rules:**
            - Cannot process without extraction
            - Cannot output without validation
            - Cannot calculate without complete data
            
        4. **Resource Constraints:**
            - Maximum 2 tasks per planning cycle
            - Prefer atomic, single-purpose tasks
            - Combine only if tasks are tightly coupled

    ## Output Format:
        - MUST use **PlanningOutput** schema:
       ```json
            {{
                "next_agents": ["a list of agents to invoke with sorted priorities per your analysis"],
                "messages": "A non-technical summary less than 4 lines: \\n **Task Planning**:\\n- First, <task 1>.\\n- Then, <task 2>. \\n-Next, <task 3>, etc."
            }}
